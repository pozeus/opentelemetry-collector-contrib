  This change affects all processors that use OTTL (i.e. `transformprocessor`, `routingprocessor`, and `filterprocessor`).
  This is a breaking change in the rare scenario that the `$` character is currently used in a replacement string.
  To output a literal `$` in a replacement string it must now be escaped with an additional `$`.
